	 * This state hasn't reached bpf_exit
	 * 2 - at least two paths are being explored.
	 * This state is an immediate parent of two children.
	 * One is fallthrough branch with branches==1 and another
	 * state is pushed into stack (to be explored later) also with
	 * branches==1. The parent of this state has branches==1.
	 * The verifier state tree connected via 'parent' pointer looks like:
	 * 1
	 * 1
	 * 2 -> 1 (first 'if' pushed into stack)
	 * 1
	 * 2 -> 1 (second 'if' pushed into stack)
	 * 1
	 * 1
	 * 1 bpf_exit.
	 *
	 * Once do_check() reaches bpf_exit, it calls update_branch_counts()
	 * and the verifier state tree will look:
	 * 1
	 * 1
	 * 2 -> 1 (first 'if' pushed into stack)
	 * 1
	 * 1 -> 1 (second 'if' pushed into stack)
	 * 0

	 * After pop_stack() the do_check() will resume at second 'if'.
	 *
	 * If is_state_visited() sees a state with branches > 0 it means
	 * there is a loop. If such state is exactly equal to the current state
	 * it's an infinite loop. Note states_equal() checks for states
	 * equvalency, so two states being 'states_equal' does not mean
	 * infinite loop. The exact comparison is provided by
	 * states_maybe_looping() function. It's a stronger pre-check and
	 * much faster than states_equal().
	 *
	 * This algorithm may not find all possible infinite loops or
	 * loop iteration count may be too high.
	 * In such cases BPF_COMPLEXITY_LIMIT_INSNS limit kicks in.
